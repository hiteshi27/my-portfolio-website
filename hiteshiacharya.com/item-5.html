		<h2>Research Assistant, NYU Civil Engineering Department </h2>
		<em>February 2015 - Present </em>
		
		<p>
			I built, designed and deployed a MATLAB GUI based Lab tool, for CIvil Engineering Department at NYU, called MAGICgeo (https://wp.nyu.edu/magicgeo/credits/).
		</p>
        <p>
            I implemented image-processing algorithms such as HBMA, DIC, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			I successfully developed a user-friendly interface to be used in laboratories by researchers and  
	    students. I ensured that MAGICgeo is error-free. I also documented the user-guide and made tutorial videos for MAGICgeo.
		</p>
        <p>
            Tools: Matlab, Git, C++
